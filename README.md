# Audio-wireleslly-controlled-RC-car
The design of an RC car that is controlled by sounds within the audible range of humans was completed successfully. 
The RC car is controlled by four different sounds that were played through a website. These allowed for forward, backward, right and left commands to be achieved. 
The use of the FFT algorithm was done to analyize the sounds picked up by the microphone on the RC car. These sounds were passed through a bandpass filter to reduce noise and allow for the racing of the RC car alongside other RC cars. 
More detailed information can be found in the final report.
